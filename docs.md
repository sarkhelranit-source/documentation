# INTRODUCTION
**STAYZ** is an tourist agent which provides the facilities for booking hotels, houses, holiday apartments and other accommodations for customers. They operate their business in India. Any customers need to book hotels, apartments they need to visit their office which is situated in Mukundapur for checking the availability as well as negotiation. Recently they have decided to change their booking pattern from manual to web based system. It will help them to manage the customers booking easily and also to keep the customers data more safe. It will also help staffs to keep in track their customer’s 
online booking request as well as easily to reply feedback to the customers.

# PROBLEMS OF CURRENT SYSTEM
As **STAYZ** is having manual booking system, they are facing some problems issuing booking requests of customers. All the necessary booking stuffs are being done in hard copy. So 
it become much difficult for staffs to keep the records updated all the time. As for example, if the customers need to change the check in date it become difficult for them to find out the customers booking details for updating as there are so many customers booking records. Again, regarding current system customers cannot give feedback online and also staff cannot reply to them promptly. So they cannot get the chance to view their apartment rooms or hotels rooms before 
they make book.

# LIMITATIONS
Although this system will provide the booking facilities to customers, it is having some limitations. In case of enquiry when customers send their feedback through the system, it will go directly to the staff mailbox. It means the system don’t have the separate web page for checking all the customers enquiry and send reply promptly. Besides the system also don’t have the online banking **(MayBank2U, CIMBClicks, PayPal)** for customers.

---

# CONCLUSION
The system is having some benefits for customers too. In home page customers can put their email address or phone number for downloading the booking apps directly on their phone. The application will work for both OS Platform (IOS & Android). By this customers can book by using this application. Besides, customers can also book online without registering into the system. Again, customers no need to worry for payment. But for reservation they need to key in their credit card details for verification purposes. It will not charge them promptly. So, overall this system will give the customers a better user friendly environment to book online.
